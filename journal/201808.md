Reddit [was hacked](https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-hacked-thanks-to-woefully-insecure-two-factor-setup/) by intercepting 2FA codes sent via SMS. The [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) explains the impact. Yet another [data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) suggests to think twice before sharing any data with any company and shift to more secure authentication systems.

# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ December 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

{introduction, major news of the month}

{if release comes out in Dec, remind to verify signatures. Decred is one of the few cryptocurrency projects that actually cares to sign releases and there is a good reasons for that. Make sure the software you install is coming untampered directly from the developers}

## Development

{per-project summary, drop items without updates}

Unless there is a binary release, new features and bugfixes are available on the master branches of the projects. This means they passed review from multiple developers and can be built from source by developers and enthusiasts, but there are no end user installers until the next release.

For web based projects like Politeia, new merged work is usually available after the deployment which happens somewhere after the merge. For dcrdata block explorer, deployment is a bit more complex: new features go to master, are deployed to alpha, then to beta, and finally to stable. {keep or revert to per-project notice?}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): On December 15th, RC1 (Release Candidate 1) of v1.4 [was announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a6a5fz/dcrd_version_140_release_candidate_1/). This version includes the [smart fee estimator](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1434), a long awaited feature that allows selections to either minimize mining delay or the fee rate, depending on what the user needs. The feature is explained in detail in its [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412). Whitelisting peers is now supported [regardless of number of connections](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1516) allowing for greater control over which nodes dcrd connects to, including wallets configured to use SPV mode.  Several performace improvements to initial sync, validation and network operations are included. Users choosing to upgrade should note there is a one-time data database migration to incorporate these changes which will take 30-60 minutes on average depending on hardware. The team [completed module versions bumps](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1541) in preparation for the v1.4 release.

A vulnerability {link} was discovered in `go get` tool that allowed remote code execution when using a malicious repository. dcrd and dcrwallet were **not affected** because they recently switched to a more secure modules system. Latest versions of dependencies are not automatically grabbed like they are in npm. Additionally, for dcrd all changes to dependencies except the runtime are audited. That is part of the reason it takes so much effort to prepare dcrd releases and why the number of dependencies should be limited. Discussed in [this chat](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$154476448242812wqgkf:decred.org)

Discussion [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1556) to implement Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) in dcrd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Tor connections from wallet to node will be available in the next release, development solved a proxy support issue [preventing connection from dcrwallet to dcrd via Tor](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1294). Capitalizing on sufficient network upgrades, modifications were completed to [reduce the default transaction fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1339) to 0.0001 DCR.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): On December 16th, RC1 (Release Candidate 1) of v1.4 [was posted](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc1). Initial Trezor support [is included](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1547) allowing users to use Decrediton as a "watch-only" wallet signing transactions from Trezor. The feature will likely be hidden behind a config option until it gets enough testing.  Staking is not included in the initial version. Selecting SPV (simple payment verification) was made easier with a new [SPV selection page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1766). Animations from [Eeter](http://www.eeter.co/) were [added for menu hover](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1816) along with a number of other style improvements including restyling [the governance page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1844) and merging the requirements for [color themes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1749). Users of the Raspberry Pi (and other ARM processor device) will have access to Decrediton thanks to [work by MatheusD](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1904) (note that [Command Line App Suite](https://www.decred.org/downloads/) has always been available for Pi). [Various design fixes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1844), [big fixes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1874) and [required patches]() were implemented. An [updated version of release notes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1854) that allows translations and past information got included. A new feature to [contruct unsigned transactions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1864) for watch-only wallets was developed (so transactions could be created on the watch-only wallet then signed and broadcast on the full wallet).

Lots of [design work](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Alinnutee+created%3A2018-12-01..2018-12-31) is ready for implementation.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): The latest [security tightening](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/935) {wait for merge} pushed Politeia's rating to A+ at [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/?q=test-proposals.decred.org&followRedirects=on), which has put it into the Security Headers top 3% and the Hall of Fame! The [ticket order](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/565) privacy enhancement development was completed for the voting tool along with a [bugfix to allow Tor](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/639) usage. [Comment tally tracking](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/610) was standardized and integrated in Politeia Web (removed from Politeia Daemon) and an [admin restriction around proposal abandoning](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/936) was integrated. Help messages were [added for common commands](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/625) first then (all major commands)(https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/640) were added.  The Politeia bulid instructions [got an overhaul](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/645).

## Integrations

{new items of infrastructure or updates from existing}

Exchange integrations:

* {is it legit? twitter is too young} https://twitter.com/HuobiRussia/status/1075424271537709058

{OTC desks}

{payment processors}

{wallets}

The hardware wallet company Ledger [tweeted](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/1072446149863329792) that the long-awaited DCR integration into their Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue was complete.

> We are excited to announce that the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue are now compatible with Decred. Decred is now available on Ledger Live and marks the first native Ledger Live integration since its launch. Read more here: https://www.ledger.fr/2018/12/11/ledger-nano-s-ledger-blue-and-ledger-live-now-support-decred-transactions/

DCR storage is now possible through Ledger Live, an application that now acts as a one-stop-shop for accessing and interacting with your crypto assets since Ledger discontinued the use of their respective apps earlier this year.
{explain:

* what this means: "first native Ledger Live integration since its launch"
* what is Ledger Live? is it a wallet? is it a web wallet? do users control keys?
* does it share data with 3rd party servers?
* is it open source?
* is firmware open source?}

Cobo Wallet [announced](https://twitter.com/cobo_wallet/status/1070805250376900609) a custodial staking service. Please do your research to understand the implications like who controls the keys, whether you lose consensus and Politeia voting rights, and so on. Discussed [here](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$154413818735775gNTIq:decred.org){keep? dig whether the service controls keys and consensus/Pi voting rights}

## Outreach

{overview of outreach/communications/marketing activity for past month and any short-term plans}

Ditto people joined #marketing and the room was very hot throughout the month. There was a lot of brainstorming and deciding on messaging.

@Dustorf, @jy-p and Ditto met in New York, report available [here](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154413732235771XIVBH:decred.org), where, amongst other things, they discussed challenges related to attracting new developers and contributors, spreading the word about Decred to knowledgeable investors, institutions, and governments, as well as going over the long term vision for the project.

@liz_bagot gave the inaugural Ditto Bi-Weekly Update [here](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154482468943386bBAIp:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org)

Update from Ditto for December:

* Had a 2.5-hour onboarding session with Dustin and Jake in our Brooklyn office in early December.
* Created a foundational messaging platform containing a breakdown of Decred's audiences, an about section, a mission statement, a vision statement, and positioning statements for each unique audience. We [submitted](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154524074346294yVYFR:decred.org) the messaging platform to the Decred community for feedback and intend to do another iteration of the document that incorporates the feedback in January.
* Attended and sent reporters from Breaker Mag, Forbes, and Fortune to Decred's meet up in NYC.
* Arranged and staffed interviews between couple big outlets and Decred community members. No set publication dates yet.
* We pitched Jake's commentary on 2019 crypto predictions with crypto reporters and secured coverage in [NullTX](https://nulltx.com/decred-co-founder-pronounces-2018-as-the-death-of-the-ico-model/), [Crypto Briefing](https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-2019-institutional-adoption/), [The Daily Hodl](https://dailyhodl.com/2018/12/21/after-bitcoin-rallies-18-industry-insiders-weigh-in-on-a-bull-run-and-cryptos-next-turn/), and [CCN](https://www.ccn.com/2018-in-4-words-icos-and-ethereum-are-dead/).

Murad Mahmudov suggests to focus the messaging on store of value aspect: https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15459293712709dEJuG:decred.org {keep?}

Now a total of 5 well-known community members have the rights to tweet via @decredproject Twitter account.

For yet another time, a lot of strange Reddit activity was timed close to our major release. It is either an unusual amount of questions about less relevant things, or "innocent" questions about trivial things, or something similar. All coming from accounts never seen before and that never stay. This notice is to inform people who care about the project to watch out for weird activity that can sap your project's, as well as your individual energy.

## Relevant External

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}

Vertcoin (VTC) was the subject of a majority (51%) [attack](https://medium.com/coinmonks/vertcoin-vtc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-53ab633c08a4) in which the chain experienced 4 incidents in which 22 reorgs and 15 double spends occurred, costing the victims around $100,000. This reaffirms the vulnerability of coins that are not the dominant use for their miners (GPU-mineable or ASIC-resistant, but also Bitcoin forks) to be attacked by miners who have appropriate hardware and no interest in the health of the blockchain. One of the impacts of these attacks is that the coin comes to be regarded as insecure, because it has failed in its purpose before. Anyone who is still willing to accept it may require a very high number of confirmations before confirming a transfer, making the coin slow to move.

The [Horizen (previously zencash)](https://www.horizen.global/) team lead recently announced a [strategic action](https://blog.zencash.com/re-strategic-actions-for-horizen-from-rolf-versluis/) to increase the Treasury block rewards from 10% to 20%, reducing the share of rewards for miners.  After a 90% reduction in price, and significant reductions to staffing and other costs, it was felt that to cut costs any further would mean jeopardizing the project. As the Treasury system being developed by IOHK is still a [prototype](https://blog.zencash.com/dao-prototype/) not yet ready for use, the team feel the need to make a unilateral decision to change the block reward. 

EOS block producer [began paying](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-node-offers-users-financial-rewards-for-votes-reignites-decentralization-debate) holders that voted for it.

The first round of voting on Aragon Governance Proposals (AGPs) has been [delayed](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-vote-delay-announcement/426) due to potential network instability around the Ethereum Constantinople hard fork - hopefully "blockchain down for maintenance" is not a problem Decred will encounter with Politeia. The CEO of Aragon Association [published](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-wishlist-and-blacklist/355) a blacklist and wishlist for proposals before proposal submissions opened. In the first proposal the AGP [process](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md) itself was [approved](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) by 99.97% of the ANT that voted. In total 2.6% of all ANT tokens voted on the first proposal, from 45 unique addresses, with ~60% of ANT votes coming from one address. AGPs go through a review by the board of the Aragon Association, then a community review, before a 48 hour voting period opens. 

2 million BTCP were mined via an exploit and went unnoticed for months until CoinMetrics noticed something is wrong with the supply and [investigated](https://coinmetrics.io/bitcoin-private) it. Developer team [posted](https://medium.com/@bitcoinprivate/official-statement-on-coinmetrics-report-6f1cef176c05) an official statement confirming the inflation exploit. The bug was merged on Jan 5 together with a patch from a bounty hunter that disengaged after receiving the reward for his work. Just one missing line of code made a huge damange to the network's value proposition. We can take a lot from this unfortunate experience: extensive test coverage, super critical review of consensus code, established reputation of developers working on mission critical parts, and having multiple implementations of the protocol are all very important to build a system we can trust money to.

There was an [attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/a9yji3/electrum_wallet_hacked_200_btc_stolen_so_far/) on Bitcoin's Electrum infrastructure. Someone started a bunch of malicious Electrum servers that prompted the user to "upgrade" to a malware version and stole 200+ BTC. The Electrum model involves a network of servers that sit between clients and full nodes. Each client depends on the server they connect to, this compromises user privacy as the owners of those servers can infer which wallets the users own. If Electrum servers were compromised this would open up some additional attacks. Decred chose not to develop Electrum infrastructure but instead go straight for client-side filtering. This delayed the development of light clients, but the SPV mode now working in dcrwallet, Decrediton and drcandroid functions independently of any service provider and enhances users' privacy as a result. 

Security researchers [demonstrated](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9563-wallet_fail) multiple ways to hack most popular hardware wallets, if in physical possession of the device.

Latest exchanges volumes report by [blockchaintransparency.org](https://www.blockchaintransparency.org/) concluded that of the coinmarketcap.com top 25 BTC pairs over 80% of volume is wash traded. Another unhappy finding is that the average project spent over $50,000 on listing fees. The report has spurred [the idea](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/34) to analyze the trading volume of DCR.

Slack can close your account if you [happen to come from a wrong country](https://twitter.com/a_h_a/status/1075510422617219077). Matrix rooms can be federated over multiple servers, so even if some participating servers are shut down, servers in other jurisdictions can keep running and keep the history.
